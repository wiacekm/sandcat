# image — i.e. the image has been rebuilt since the volume was populated,
# so packages installed during the build are hidden by the stale volume
# overlay at /home/vscode.
#
# A tolerance is applied because Docker Compose creates named volumes
# before building images on fresh installs, which leaves the image
# naturally a few seconds newer than the volume even when nothing is
# stale. A genuine post-install rebuild produces a much larger gap.
